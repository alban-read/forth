Things to do:
  * respond to scroll request from the wimp
  * handle caret correctly
  * accelerate some code (I feel that the string
      routines in the kernel deserve recoding)

Perhaps somebody can come up with some proposals
concerning the points above or some other
improvement of the system.

Alban Read modifications to work on the RISC PC.
Added code cache clearence to allow the compiler to work on the StrongARM processor.

Other modifications
Changed the definition of centre: ( the window was not on the screen.)
Stopped processing the command line as it picks up garbage from the RISCOS buffer most of the time.

Faked a cursor for the edit window.
