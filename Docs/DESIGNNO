    ## Code Structure of the WimpForth dictionary

    ### The Header Structure:

      Dummy bytes, so that the                 00 00
      NAME FIELD: name-characters length-byte  'F' 'O' 'R' 'T' 'H' 05
        ends word aligned
      VIEW FIELD: line number in source file   xx xx xx xx
      LINK FIELD: address of previous word
        in this thread                         yy yy yy yy
      CODE FIELD: code
      
    The NEXT macro consists of the instruction

         ldr pc, [ ip ], # 4

    This means that after the header NEXT expects code at the CFA.
    
    Code words will start their viscious work immediately.
    Deferred words load the pc from the next cell: ldr pc, [ pc, # -4 ]

    Other words will branch with link to their DO***** routines
    (see beginning of fkernel for details).
    
    Win32Forth by Andrew McKewan and Tom Zimmer, from which WimpForth
    is heavily derived, expects a pointer to code in the CFA.

    This makes WimpForth programs incompatible with utilities in
    Win32Forth. But you can fix it by replacing every @ on CFAs
    with a CALL@.
