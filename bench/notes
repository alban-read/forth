Some common FORTH benchmarks

Benchmarks were originally written for the 1990s 486 PC generation.
Compared to which all systems tested below run like greased lightning.
repeated 10 times now; for modern systems.

Expectation
WimpForth uses a threaded interpreter; words are compiled down to lists of addresses that are executed by a fast inner interpreter; this is the classic FORTH approach and makes for a fast and compact interpreter.
Commercial FORTH systems are compilers where words are converted to machine code, inlined and optimized; compilers are much faster.

You need WimpSlot in !Run set to a couple of megabytes for benchmarks.
